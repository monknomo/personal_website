Summary: Projects that I am doing and have done

I like to keep busy, so I make projects

* [Stand Up](http://standup.gunnargissel.com 'Get up already!')
    - This is a little script to remind me to stand up and move around every hour.  I've been meaning to make it a little prettier and to resize a bit better
* [C25k tracker](http://c25k.gunnargissel.com 'Go run already!')
    - This is a tracker for the [C25k](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) program.  It lets me figure out what I've already done
* [Triple Sec Diary](http://tsdiary.gunnargissel.com 'What is this good for?')
    - This is a faintly ridiculous project that I made after reading about a [reversible encryption library.](https://keybase.io/triplesec/triplesec_now_in_python.html)  It is a diary that stays in your browser's local storage and encrypts itself.
* [Porsche 944](http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/build-projects-and-project-cars/junky-ol-porsche-944/63679/page1/ 'My ride')
    - [A car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_944 'What a Porsche may look like') I have been tinkering with for a while
