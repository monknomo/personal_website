Summary: Transparent enumeration of realistic goals is supposed to help with motivation, so consider this me motivating myself


I've read, like the rest of you internet creatures, that having goals and sharing them is encouraging and helps you reach your goals.


I've also read that concrete, attainable goals are better than pie in the sky fantasy goals.


So here it goes:


* Write at least 50 blog posts, or roughly one a week
* Get site traffic that moves the needle on google analytics - 5 people a day would satisfy me
* Get at least one subscriber on my mailing list


The year is half over, but I'm not going to let that stop me.  I'm about 10 posts in and I think I get something like 3 visitors a week whenever I post something new.  Hopefully they aren't all robots :)
