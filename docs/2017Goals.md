2017 Goals
===========


So, given how 2016 went, what are my plans for 2017?


I'm going to stick to the same basic plans, but scaled back a touch so I have some chance of hitting them.


Blog Goals
-----------


* 26 blog posts this year
* Measurable blog traffic
* Create some tools for people
    * Talk about tools


Personal Goals
-----------------


* Be present in year 2 of the baby's life
* Figure out how to manage a toddler
* Bicycle
* Lose 20 lbs (I lost 40 last year, so this is just a touch up to get where I want + a little padding for the occasional dessert)
* Pare down household to a manageable level of stuff
* Tweak savings plan to account for global instability
* Pick one worthy political cause to be active in
* Keep up sociability


Professional Goals
------------------


* Learn how to build Javascript build/packaging/deploy systems
* Get a grip on messaging and Service Oriented Architectures
* Beef up supervisory and leadership skills
* Succesfully project manage rollout of new Sealandings client
* Project manage migration from legacy Flex monolith to SOA and Javascript system


Summary
--------------


Having written all this out, I notice I have a lot more personal goals than blog goals.  I think that's ok - I don't intend to live this blog.  I suspect blogs are more interesting when they are written by someone who is living.  I also notice most of my professional goals are along the project management and architectural lines.  I think that's most likely normal at this stage in my career.  My techincal skills are sufficient to the tasks I do, so it seems natural to want to focus on the meta-technical and support skills.
