Summary: I have a few passion projects, like pywe, the Windows Python helper and, notecard-wiki, the wiki for notes

PyWE
===========

[PyWE (Python Windows Environment)](http://www.github.com/monknomo/pywe) is a collection of scripts that make it easier to install multiple versions of python, switch between different versions of python and create/activate/deactivate per-python virtual environments.

Notecard Wiki
