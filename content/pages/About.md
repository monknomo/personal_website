Summary: Who is Gunnar and what does he do?

I grew up in [Juneau,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneau "My hometwown") which is a small town in Southeast Alaska.

Later I went to school at [Carnegie Mellon University,](http://www.cmu.edu/physics/ "My alma mater") where I studied physics. During summers I worked at the Sears Dealer Store my parents owned.
From there I went to work at the [US Patent Office.](http://www.uspto.gov "work history") I worked in the Measuring and Testing art unit (2856 represent!), which covers a pretty wide variety of devices and techniques, some more interesting than others. My personal favorite patent application that I worked on was US 7,484,408, for being a relatively clever way of measuring a foot's volume and using fewer materials than other similar devices.

Patent examining was always just a way of paying the bills.  What I really wanted to do was program.  After some searching, I left to program for [NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov "current employer") in my hometown.

At NOAA, I work on the [eLandings project,](http://www.elandings.alaska.gov "My main project") although I sometimes fill in for internal projects on the [Alaska Region's Catch Accounting System.](http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/ "Other projects") Elandings is a reporting software used by commercial fisherman to tell NOAA and the [Alaska Department of Fish and Game](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/ "Inter-agency compadres") how many fish they've caught and/or processed. I work on the web interface, the server side, database portions and a Java Swing client. Most of what I work on is concentrated in the [logbook](https://elandings.alaska.gov/confluence/display/doc/eLogbook+Instructions "My baby") and [groundfish reporting](https://elandings.alaska.gov/confluence/display/doc/eLandings+User%27s+Guide "Everything else") portions of the system.

I am also the project lead for our internal permitting application, Alders.  Alders is a flex app with a Hibernate backend that talks to an Oracle database.  We use it to manage permits, associated fish quota, users and other regulatory activity.  The most exciting part of the Alders project is fitting it into a continuous integration environment.
