I attended [Joseph Matsey's](http://josephmastey.com/) talk on building a culture of learning at [Abstraction's](http://abstractions.io/) last year.  I really enjoyed the talk, and have been thinking about and implementing ideas from it over the past year.  Here's a summary of my takeaway for the 3 different phases of culture building (with a bonus 4th phase, of "you have a culture")

Guerilla Learning
--------------------------

This is where a lot of places start - there isn't really any particular culture of learning, but some learning exercises and activities are supported

* High resistance to taking time from shipping
* Ad hoc learning
* Onboarding by oral tradition
* Few folks driving learning
* __Approach__
    * Think opportunistically
    * Improve team members primary roles
    * Seek fast returns with low investment
    * __Examples__
         * Workshops
         * Meetups
         * Build a team library
         * New hire buddies
             * Try cross-team buddies
    * __Dangers__
        * Buy in never starts
        * Stay stuck in guerilla learning forever
    
Buy in Starts
----------------------

This is a dangerous intermediate phase, where some culture building has happened, but it's not baked in or fully supported by management

* New hires have some kind of organized learning
* Team members want more, but aren't empowered
* __Approach__
    * leverage internal experts (workshops, talks)
    * Seed good role models (and shame everyone else)
    * Mentor mentors (mentorship is an orthogonal skillset to what you do at work)
    * __Examples__
        * Weekly talks, 4 15 minute talks
        * Project updates
        * Tech approaches
        * Senior leadership talks
        * Ops talks
    * __Dangers__
        * Key folks leaving
        * "Takes too much time" payout not obvious, track and figure out how to measure returns
        * Mentor burnout
        
Making it Stick
-----------------------

This is the final phase, that takes management buy in, re-programming existing employees and enculturating new hires

* Boringly normal
    * From "workshops are amazing" to "oh god a workshop"
* __Approach__
    * Momentum to sustain effort
    * Sustained learning    
    * Make people forget the old way
    * __Examples__
        * learning/teaching as a KIP
        * Apprenticeships
        * 3 part onboarding
            * Teach skills
            * Teach processes, history and context
            * Personal development
        * 20% time
    * __Dangers__
        * Payoffs hard to measure
        * No one is responsible
        * losing the habit
        
Self Sustaining
-----------------

At some critical mass point, it continues lurching forward.  This point is when you have a durable culture of learning
