Summary: There is a discreet checkbox at the bottom of the left hand block of text that disable the Atom.js startup Welcome Guide


I've been test driving Atom.js and I like it pretty well.  Something I don't like about it, is that the startup welcome guide keeps coming back.  After several days of using it, I finally noticed how to turn it off.


In the left hand pane, at the bottom of the text there is a checkbox that disables the Welcome Guide.  I think it's pretty hard to see, at least with the dark theme, but just uncheck it and you are good to go.
