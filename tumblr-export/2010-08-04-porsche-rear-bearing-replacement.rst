| |image0|\ I was replacing my cv joints, since I had a cv-bolt mishap,
and it seemed like the time to do it. While I was under there, I noticed
the stub axles had a bit of play in them, which probably indicates worn
wheel bearings.

Since I've got so many other things to do to the Porsche, I figured,
'What the heck?' So I'm replacing the bearings.

I started by pulling off the discs, and brake calipers. This confirmed
my prior opinion of totally shot parking brakes, so I suppose I'll fix
those up too, while I'm in there.

I used the `arnnworx bearing puller`_ to remove the bearings. The
removal and installation process went very smoothly, thanks to a
combination of the `guide`_ arnnworx provides and the factory manual.

The main thing that I think the factory manual does better than arnnworx
is only unbolting the side of the axle attached to the transmission, and
removing the whole half-axle, stub axle assembly at once. Compared to
removing the half-axle separately, it was a lot easier this way. Of
course, I ended up taking the stub axle off anyhow to refurb my cv
joints, but it was the thought that counts.

As you can see, letting your Porsche sit in the rainforest can lead to
some brake degradation.

What you can't see is it can also lead to gigantic spiders leaping out
of the brake drum and frightening you halfway across the garage. Good
thing the garage has excellent sound insulation, or my girlish shrieks
might have alarmed the neighbors.
