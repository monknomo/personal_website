I read about `triplesec.js`_ on `hn`_ and thought it was pretty cool. 
The developers suggested that it might be nice to make a journal (among
other things).  I thought that sounded like a good idea and I sort of
wanted a little journal app anyhow.

My plan is to use triplesec to encrypt/decrypt the content and, local
storage to keep the encrypted journal content.  `Epiceditor`_ (I really
like epiceditor for a markdown editor/previewer) is my choice for
inputting/editing the markdown for each journal entry.  Of course, a
small modification will be needed because I can’t figure out how to get
text out of epic editor without saving a draft, which I don’t want to
do.  Then I just need to make a nice responsive layout and l should have
a little journaling app ready to go.

I’ve been on sort of a subconscious Johnny Depp kick, so the obvious
name is \ `“The Triplesec Diary”`_
