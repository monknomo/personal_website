I was inspired by the `Luma Labs`_ guys to try my hand at a sling for my
big camera.  It came with a conventional neck sling, but It was sort of
uncomfortable and left the lens sticking way out in the middle of my
chest.  Also, it made me look like a tourist

I didn't take any pictures of the construction, but here's what I did:

I basically took a sawzall to a bit of strap from Home Depot (it's the
kind of strap about 1/16" thick and has two sizes of holes drilled at
regular intervals along its length - like plumber's tape on steroids).
 I cut it about 2" long and narrow enough for the battery compartment on
my camera to still open.  Then I filed off the rough edges and wrapped
it in electrical tape.  I still wanted to use my Gorilla Pod mount, so I
got a slightly longer 1/4" bolt and dremeled a washer to fit in the bolt
depression of the Gorilla Pod's mounting shoe.  The I bolted it all
together and made sure I could still fit the camera on a triped.  I
finished the ensemble with some cord and a strap from a Nike duffel bag.

It basically boils down to a little piece of metal with two hole, some
tape, some washers and a bit of string.  I think it hold the camera
nicely at my side, though.
