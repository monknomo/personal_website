I've wanted to to try a standing desk, but I didn't want to buy anything
or spend a lot of money.  After all, I might not like it.

My first thought was to use `milk crates`_, but I've used my crates for
enough other things that I only have one free one, and I'd need at least
three.  I thought about 2x4 and\ `Simpson Strong Ties`_, but that would
be sort of excessively ugly for the office.

Inspiration struck while I was staring at my `tetrahedral kite`_ frame -
why not make a space frame?

I pillaged my design from radio tower masts and am testing it out with
ten pounds of grain, before I risk my monitor.  So far, so good.

I might talk a bit about making connectors and tuning strut lengths to
make the structure plumb and level.  Twist is something of an issue with
this technique, because the vinyl tube has some inherent twist and 3/16
dowels are not the straightest material, either.  The pre-load from
imprecise cuts and connectors also likely adds some (ok, the lion's
share) twist.
