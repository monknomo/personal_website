As I've been working on this\ `Triplesec Diary`_ I've been asking
myself, "What is an encrypted diary good for?"

The pat answer is "Secrets."

I find this answer unsatisfying on several levels.  The first is that
most people's secrets suck.  Literally no one but them cares and they
could write them in a LiveJournal and take out ads for it in Times
Square and still no one would read them without a gun pointed at their
head.

The second is that people with secrets that don't suck often need to
keep them secret in the context of the government.  Regardless of what
you think about the NSA's crypt ability, the government has two simple
tools to crack your encrypted diary.  They can subpoena the key and then
throw you in jail for contempt when you refuse to provide it.  You may
enjoy news of a `"Free Joe Political Prisoner"`_ rally attended by five
slashdotting `neckbeards`_ (I say this with fondness; I might match the
description), but you will rot in jail.  I should mention that this is
the best case in relatively free governments.  In less free governments,
the next point applies.

The third case is that `it is worth beating secrets out of people`_ with
secrets worth keeping.  Whether the gestapo, the mafia or just a really
motivated guy, if you have a secret worth keeping, the first step in
keeping it must be to secure yourself.  All the encryption in the world
can't help you if if you are strapped to a chair getting worked over
with a rubber hose.

Of course, in the modern world, `one doesn't have to`_ `resort to
violence to`_ `circumvent an encrypted diary.`_  Part of the point of a
diary is that it is openable so its owner can read and write to it.  In
order to read the diary, it must be shown on the screen.  In order to
write to the diary, you must type.  The trouble with that, is there are
all sorts of nefarious ways to look at or listen in on user activity on
a computer.  If your computer has been compromised or infected, simply
using an encrypted diary will reveal what you sought to hide.

For an encrypted diary to make sense you must have secrets that are
important to you, be secure in your person, be secure in your
environment and be secure in your computer.  Avoid being kidnapped or
abducted, have a house or place of business that is difficult to break
in to or gain unauthorized access to, and keep viruses off your machine.
 The old joke is that a secure computer is one that is turned off,
filled with concrete and buried and that applies, even if you encrypt
your data.
