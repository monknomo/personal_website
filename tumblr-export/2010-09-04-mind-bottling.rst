| |image0|\ We reached the end (more or less) of our nut brown's
fermentation, so we bottled. That took most of the morning, scrubbing
bottles, sanitizing bottle, putting sugar in bottle, beer in bottles. A
very bottle-centric day.
| We ended up with roughly 50 bottles of beer. Initial tasting was
interesting. The beer was flat (obviously), and have a faint citrus
after-taste. Kind of grapefruity.
