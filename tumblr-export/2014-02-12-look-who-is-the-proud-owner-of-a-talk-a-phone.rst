Look who is the proud owner of a Talk-A-Phone intercom system.  It is
really lovely in sort of a brushed metal future 70's kind of way.  I'll
have to get some wire to hook them all together, but my initial tests
seem to indicate that they work.  I'll need longer wires to avoid the
terrible feedback squeal

No instruction manuals, but the bottoms have some diagrams with guidance
for what wire goes where, so hopefully these are as easy to operate as
they appear.  I'm pretty sure they are literally a speaker and a
microphone with a switch.  The main unit has an amp and more switches.
 Looks like it's time to buy some wire and a bunch of spade terminals!

I'll post some shots of the bottoms and my wiring results when I know
more.

The guy at state surplus thought they looked like something off Magnum
PI, and he's not wrong.
