| We're coming out of a week or two of the usual Juneau drizzle.  Today
the sun is shining, and the sky is a beautiful blue, all lighting up
100' of fog in the channel.  The cruise ships are docking, sounding
their fog horns as they slowly move into place.  I can see the top of
their stacks and radar trees, but the rest is buried in the fog.

| I wish I had a camera, but I'm all out of batteries.  I'll just have
to remember seeing the big ships pirouette in the clinging fog.
