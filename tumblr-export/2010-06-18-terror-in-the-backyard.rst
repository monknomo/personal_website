| Three weeks ago (my how I've let time get away from me), on a Saturday
| morning, I decided to make a special breakfast of plättar pancakes,
| which isn't especially unusual. R, was up and about, and as I loaded
| up a plate for the two of us, R commented that there was a strange
| noise outside.

| We went to the porch, and I assumed we'd see the usual neighbor kids
| playing some game or other, making weird noises. Much to our
| surprise, we saw a dog attacking a fawn. We yelled at the dog, and
| after a few tries, he let the fawn go and sat down to watch it with
| characteristic doggy zeal. R ran down to the yard to check on the
| fawn and dog. The fawn was pretty chewed up and couldn't use its back
| legs anymore. The dog was mostly excited.

| By this time, our neighbors had discovered the scene and we also
| rushing outside or to their phones. I called animal control and
| described the situation. They sent two men who looked at the deer.
| The dog, by this time, had escaped, but one of the neighbors found the
| dogs owner, whom I put in touch with the animal control people. I
| also gave the animal control people a statement. By this time, the
| situation looked well in hand, so R and I went to eat our rather cold
| plättar.

As we sat down we heard a shot, and rushed to the window. The fawn must
have been far gone, because the animal control guys called the JPD and
the officer dispatched it with his sidearm. I knew, in the back of my
head, that they don't give deer first aid, but I was still a little
surprised.

If I was a better blogger, I'd have taken more pictures of the scene,and
maybe a shot of the offender and victim, but I'm not, so I only caught
the aftermath.
