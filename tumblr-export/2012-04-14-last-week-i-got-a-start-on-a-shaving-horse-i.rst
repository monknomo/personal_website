Last week I got a start on a `shaving horse.`_  I more or less took the
idea from `here`_.  I want to be able to take the clamp off, so I can
have a regular bench when I'm not shaving something.  I still need to
finish up the clamp and make a regular bench topper.

It's grey, because that's the only color I have at the moment, and paint
is expensive
