I need to replace at least the outbound fuel line under the Porsche.
 The return line could probably use replaced too, but I'd have to drop
the gas tank to do that, and I'd have to drop the transmission to drop
the gas tank, so basically, I don't think it's bad enough yet...
 Hopefully I won't regret saying that.

I learned a lot about hose fitting and dimensions from `Arnnworx`_ and
did most of my sourcing from\ `Batinc.`_  I opted to switch out my beat
up hardlines for 3/8" tubing, because finding metric tubing and fittings
in Alaska is really hard.  Also 3/8" tubing opens up AN fittings, which
are easier to find that metric fittings on this side of the Atlantic.  I
do still have to use adapters to hook up the OEM Porsche stuff to the AN
stuff.  Hopefully I'll see a big box of parts and then I can get to
bending tubes and double flaring tube ends.  Soon, I may be able to
start the car without a fuel weep at the back end!
