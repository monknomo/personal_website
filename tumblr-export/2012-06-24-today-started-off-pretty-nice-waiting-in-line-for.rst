|Toxic waste dump day|

|Clouded up fast this evening!|

Today started off pretty nice, waiting in line for our toxic waste
disposal, but it sure clouded the heck up this evening!  Reminds me of a
thunderstorm down south, but we pretty much never get those up here...
 I suppose we shall see if it goes all the way or if it just has black
clouds everywhere.
