I must not rust.

Rust is the car-killer.

Rust is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

I will face the rust.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the rust has gone there will be nothing.

Only plastic will remain.

Saw this over on Hooniverse.  Anybody who's ever had an older car and
lived somewhere with winter knows what's this about.  My Honda has the
tinworm in the wheel arches, and I'm afraid no amount of Bene Gesserit
litanies will save it
