|image0|\ This curious piece of equipment is an immersion chiller we
ginned up. It's just copper coils with hose connections, but it will
allow us to cool wort (or soups) very quickly. The idea is to connect a
hose to both ends, and have water flow through one and drain through the
other.

We used the cheap Ace hardware brass connectors, which are known to
cause cancer to both California and Vermont, so it is probably for the
best that the water stay *in* the cooler, but if it works as designed,
we could cool with raw sewage or pure dioxin. Which is to say, suitable
precautions will need to be taken.
