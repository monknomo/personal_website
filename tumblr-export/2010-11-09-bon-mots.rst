Maureen Dowd's \ `column`_ is her usual, but it did have this little
excerpt from Bush's book, which I thought was pretty good:

Yet if W.'s decision-making leaves something to be desired, his
story-telling is good. He writes of a visit to Russia, when Putin showed
him his black Labrador, Koni. "Bigger, stronger, and faster than
Barney," Putin bragged.

Later, when W. recounted this to Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime
minister, Harper drolly noted, "You're lucky he only showed you his
dog."
