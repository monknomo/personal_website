R and I went camping on Memorial Day weekend. You can see I'm still
pretty late with the storytelling.

Anyways, we were at Eagle Beach, on the Boy Scout camp side of the
river, and not only was the midnight sun difficult to sleep through, the
whales wouldn't shut up. I had forgotten, but a pod of hungry whales
splashes, flukes, snorts and wails! Really, that whalesong is louder
than the waves on the beach.

To top it off, the Coast Guard was buzzing up and down the coast most of
the night with a Jayhawk, so that cut into the old shuteye as well. The
office rumor is that some yahoo fired off a flare and Coasties were
doing due diligence to make sure it wasn't a boater and was just one of
the out-the-road revelers. I can't fault them for doing their job, but
between them, the whales and the midnight sun I didn't sleep. I'd do it
again without hesitation, though.

Since we were camping, we had nothing but the finest cuisine.

I forgot that canned hash for breakfast meant that I should bring a can
opener. Between R's marlinspike and a rock, we still got it open.
