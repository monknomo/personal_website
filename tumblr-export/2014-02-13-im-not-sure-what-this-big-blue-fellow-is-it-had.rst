I'm not sure what this big blue fellow is.  It had four leads coming out
of the base and claimed that its case was negative.  Big cap?  Vacuum
tube?  It is between the part that I think is an amp and the part that
steps down and converts the AC to DC.

The transformers above the blue fellow are the parts that weathered time
the worst.  The rest of it was in pretty spotless condition.  Must not
have been in a smoking office, which is a little hard to believe if it
is as old as I think.
