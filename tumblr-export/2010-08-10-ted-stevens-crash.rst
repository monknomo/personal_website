| I just saw the news.  I hope he's ok.  It would be a real shame to
lose him so suddenly after all he's been through these past few years. 
Still, if he didn't make it, it is as fitting a way to go as any for a
great Alaskan.

| R had the honor of working for him during his last tumultuous year in
office.I'm glad she had that chance.
| I hope he got lucky, but at 86, with one nasty plane crash under his
belt already, I'm worried.
