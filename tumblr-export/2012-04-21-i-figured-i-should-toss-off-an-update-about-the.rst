I figured I should toss off an update about the table, as well.  I
noticed a day or two ago that it was wobblier than I remembered,
investigated and found that one of my horizontals had cracked.  I tried
gluing it up (not really expecting it to work) and that wasn't quite
satisfactory.  So, I figured just make a new one and put it in!

I think it all started because I didn't drill pilot holes for the deck
screws.  I probably should have done that, since there are so many and
I'm using kind of thin wood.
