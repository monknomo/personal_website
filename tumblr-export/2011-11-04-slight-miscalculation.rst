I left my citrus seedling near the window yesterday, because it was the

first sun we've had in a month or so. I forgot to take it away at night

and it must have been cold, because it's pretty wilted now.

I'm not sure it'll be able to make a comeback, but here's hoping. Maybe
a

little greenhouse will help things out?
