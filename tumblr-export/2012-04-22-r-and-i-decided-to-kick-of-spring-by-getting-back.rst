R and I decided to kick of spring by getting back into brewing.  We did
a partial mash with a pale ale malt extract base.  Lightly hopped
with Willamette hops.  We also made a `checklist`_ that really made the
whole process go smoothly.

The key, or at least what has worked for us, is planning out what we are
going to do, before we do it.  It avoids us running around with `Yakety
Sax`_ playing in the background.  That always ends up with wort on the
floor and moths in the fermentor.
