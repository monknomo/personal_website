R and I thought of the 100 hours when we were talking about New Year's
resolutions, although at first we were going to compete in a 1000 hour
contest.  We thought of a few resolutions, then one of us, I can't
recall which, said something like, "I'm going to ride a thousand hours
on the bicycle."  And the other said something like, "I bet I can do it
first!"

After we thought about it, and did some back of the envelope math, we
scaled our time back, since 1000 hours would take ~3 years at an hour a
day.  We figured 100 hours was good, because a dedicated, reasonably in
shape cyclist could do it in around 3 months.  So far we haven't proved
ourselves sufficiently in shape, or maybe we're insufficiently
dedicated, but we have been spinning on.

To keep the contest interesting, we have a cycling jersey riding on
the outcome - loser buys the winner a jersey of their choice.  Another
contributing factor to choosing 100 hours is that by the end of it, we
might be slim enough to wear a jersey more like a jersey and less like a
sausage casing.

| So far, on the slimming front, we've been losing about 1lb an hour of
cycling.  I thought that was interesting enough to start making an
effort to keep a weight log, so I can see how long that trend lasts.
 Can't last forever, or I'd be way, way too skinny by the end..
