I'm watching Living Witness, which has a fake Evil Janeway.  I want to
see that series!

Evil Janeway is totally badass and running through their galaxy the way
I picture a lost superior starship doing so.  It's like if Saul Tighe
were running a Federation ship...

On a related note, Tuvak should have had an evil goatee in their
simulation.  Total lost opportunity.
