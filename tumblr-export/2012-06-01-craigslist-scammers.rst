I'm trying to sell my car on craigslist, and it has attracted the
typical

scammer interest. One benefit to living in a part of Alaska with no
roads

in or out is that scammers are somewhat more obvious. Anyone who lived

somewhere else and actually wanted to buy a car here would be mad to pay

the $1k+ to get to the nearest port. I could see it if I was selling a
one

of kind car, but a Honda with a common swap, no sir.

The typical cue is that scammers never mention anything specific about

whatever you're selling. This guy asks if I still have the "item" for

sale, not even bothering stepping up to the more specific, but still

generic, "car." I like his addition of naval sob story combined with a

birthday story further combined with a pastor story. "You can trust me,

it's for a religious professional!"

There are days when I wonder if this is some sort of bizarre viral

marketing for Paypal that has just gotten out of hand. I'm also not sure

if offering style advice to scammers is moral, but I wouldn't mind if
they

tossed in more punctuation and paragraphs. It'd be easier on the eyes,
at

least.
