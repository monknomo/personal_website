Our dinner entree at the last campout was Mountain House Beef
Stroganoff. I think I paid about $6 from Fred Meyer's for it.

It looks delicious, when dry. I can say that the chunks are light and
that you should remember to remove the silica gel packet (!) or someone
will get an unfortunate surprise in their

Cooked, it looks a little better, but the $50 question that everyone
wants the answer to is, "Does it taste okay?" I give a whole hearted,
unqualified sorta. Like most Mountain House, it is very salty, but it
has a decent texture for freeze dried food, and is filling. I wouldn't
want to live on it, but if you don't feel like packing something heavy,
or making something a little more creative, the stroganoff gets the job
done.

Fortunately, marshmallows are light and compliment extra salty
freeze-dried food pretty well. I recommend making them golden brown and
eating them hot on the beach to eradicate the memory of the stroganoff.
R thinks she could do freeze dried better. I'm skeptical, but willing to
give it a try. Just as long as she keeps her vacuum freezer off my
marshmallows.
