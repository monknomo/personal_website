I've been cleaning out my garage and decided I should probably sell my
unicycle, since I never ride it.  I tried posting a photo-less "Rusty
Unicycle For Sale" craigslist post, to see if anyone would bite, but
nobody did (so much for laziness).

Obviously I needed to clean off the rust if I'm going to sell the
'cycle.  I had read that vinegar is a poor man's rust converter, so I
hosed the unicycle down with vinegar, touching it up every so often, for
a morning.  Then I scrubbed it lightly with some steel wool, and it
looked pretty good at the end.
