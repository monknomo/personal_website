Our house has wooden frame, single pane windows, so when winter rolls
around, it gets cold.  On some level that's okay, because heat is
included in the rent.  But, even with the furnace on full blast, we can
feel our heat seeping out the windows and the icy winds of Alaska
howling in.

They sell kits at hardware stores and Fred Meyer's that you can use to
seal off your windows.  R and I bought one and tried it out, and it
worked, but it was $3.50 and is only some double stick tape, plastic and
instructions.  Not to mention it wasn't quite long enough for our
windows.

We thought it over and realized that the plastic is the same stuff as
shrink wrap and the double-sided tape is just regular old removable
double-sided tape.

We trekked over to the store and picked up a roll of shrinkwrap (Joann's
basket making supplies) and double-sided Scotch tape (Fred Meyer's).
 Our total cost was about $12 and I think we can do every window in the
house for the next two or three years.  40'x40" of shrinkwrap!

Our secret procedure is to cut out the plastic to fit the window and
then put the double-sided tape on the top of the window frame and then
stick the plastic to it, stretching it fairly taught.  After that the
plastic hangs down and sticks to our frames with static (unless there is
a radiator running underneath, in which case they billow outward).  We
then stick some double-sided tape to the bottom of the frame and adhere
the plastic wrap to that tape.  We used 1' strips at the edges and
middle of the window.  Finally we taped the edges with a 1' strip in the
center of the frame.

At this point, a perfectionist would use a hairdryer to shrinkwrap their
window.  We don't own a hairdryer, so we settled for trimming the edges.
