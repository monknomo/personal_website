I've still been working on the Porsche, just nothing very photogenic.
 I've got my replacement fuel hardline made, so I've been starting in on
the rubber hoses.  I went with Aeroquip pushlok fittings because they
seemed easier to source and assemble in my garage than some of the
fancier options.  `Arnnworx`_\ has a `great fuel line tutorial`_ with a
`pretty good pushlok assembly guide`_.

I felt the need to animate the most crucial step.  After lubricating the
fitting and heating the hose and pushing it all together, I was left
with about 1/8" to go.  This time I microwaved some water to near
boiling and let the hose sit for a couple minutes before putting it in
the vice and darn near standing on it.  I guess a little twisting motion
is the trick, but mostly make like a moose and muscle it on.
