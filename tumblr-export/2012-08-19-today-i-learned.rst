that driveshaft disconnects are a thing, and I have one...

So, yesterday I was replacing the u-joints on the Ranger when I noticed
that the replacements I bought and the u-joint I took off were not the
same size.  Same diameter, but totally different lengths.  I also played
with the collar, which I originally thought was part of some hillbilly
driveshaft brake, but it instead appears to lock the shaft to the tail.
 A bit of googling, and I think I have a Remco driveshaft disconnect kit
installed, which uses pre '98 u-joints.  I guess the previous owner was
an RVer.  Makes me want to change the diff fluid, just to be sure.

Another trip to the parts store and I armed myself with the proper
parts.
