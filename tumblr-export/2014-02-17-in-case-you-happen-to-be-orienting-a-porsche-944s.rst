In case you happen to be orienting a Porsche 944's brake caliper
pistons, a triangle with a 20 degree angle is helpful.  I used `Wolfram
Alpha`_ to make one, since I was too lazy to find either a ruler or a
protractor.

The cutout should face into the rotor's rotation.  That means, for the
front brakes, it should face to floor.  The consequences for screwing it
up are slightly faster wearing pads.
