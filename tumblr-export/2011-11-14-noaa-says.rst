| I suspect this means I have a lot more shoveling to look forward to.
| Speaking of shoveling, as I was finishing shoveling the driveway for
the 4th time, this time to get rid of the berm so I could pull in from
the street, the snowplow visited again.  Completely blocked in my
driveway again.  I, and one of my neighbors who was shoveling her
driveway both kind of gave the driver a dirty look as he went by.  I
guess he felt a little bad, because he came back by and gave our
driveways a special touch-up.  I'm not sure our neighbors will
appreciate the extra load in their berm, but it's the fortunes of
winter.
