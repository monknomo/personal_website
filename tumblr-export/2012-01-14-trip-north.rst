I've returned from the frozen wastes of the far north, and I have
pictures I'd like to put up, but I took them with my new camera and
forgot my cable up there. Â It's some sort of new-fangled ultra-mini usb
-> regular usb converter, or maybe a mini-hdmi -> regular usb converter,
but at any rate, photos are stuck on my sd card until I break down and
buy a cable or a reader.
