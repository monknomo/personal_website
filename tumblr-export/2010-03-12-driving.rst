| Yesterday, coming home from work on the highway, a car turned in front
| of me. It was at a left turn at a legal spot, but they cut it so
| close I very nearly t-boned them. I slammed on the brakes, which in
| the non-abs Saturn put the car into a light skid, so I backed off and
| started pumping. By the time the other car had cleared itself from in
| front of me, I was almost at a dead stop and perhaps 3 feet from the
| tail of my over-eager friend. A quick check in my rearview mirror
| showed a towering Dodge Ram barreling down on me; although I suppose
| he was really only driving at normal highway speeds it looked
| intimidating.

| At, or slightly before, this point another car decided it should turn
| left. I find myself directly in its path, so the combination of
| imminent rear-ending and t-boning compels me to drop a couple gears
| and floor it.

| I escaped very shaken, because not one, but two people tried to kill
| me within seconds of each other. Maybe I need more headlights,
| because people don't react appropriately to the ones I've got.

| I've illustrated the encounter, because I don't trust my verbal
| description, and because I find it strangely satisfying to draw out
| the offense. I included speed lines, so everyone knows who's going
| where.
