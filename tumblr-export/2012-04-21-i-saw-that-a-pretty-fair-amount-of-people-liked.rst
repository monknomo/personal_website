I saw that a pretty fair amount of people liked the potting table.  I
cribbed most of the design from `Scout Regalia`_, but I modified it a
bit.  I figured I'd prefer something a little bigger than two by two,
and that deck screws and galvanized lag screws would weather better up
here in the rainforest.  I also varnished mine, because wood doesn't
weather, so much as crumble to wet dust up this way.

I'm pretty sure you could get away with ~2 shipping pallets and some
creativity, too.
