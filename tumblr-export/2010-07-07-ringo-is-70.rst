| I knew the Beetles were getting up there, but 70 seems like a pretty
big marker.  Ringo still gives a pretty decent `interview`_.  In my
mental pool of "When Will Famous Musicians from the 60's Die?" I have
Ringo as outliving them all.  You compare him to the Stones, or even
Paul McCartney and he looks 10, 20 years younger.  I wonder if he gets
his hair dyed?
