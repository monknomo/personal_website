| I've been enjoying being back up; I missed Eaglecrest during my
| sojourn in the south. It's a pity, although not an unpredictable
| pity, that this year hasn't been a great snow year. Still, this looks
| better than skiing in New Jersey (at Traction Park).

| On a side note, I'm impressed with how well the Saturn climbs up the
| mountain. All I've given it is a single studded tire (on the rear
| passenger side), and a three worn out winter tires. I haven't slid
| off the road yet, but I've seen a jeep, a couple trucks and some
| soft-roader in the ditch on the way up. Before you berate me for
| stopping to help, most of these were either empty of people or had
| police on the scene.

| Maybe, for a future project, a comparison of the Saturn to the Porsche
| 944 is in order. I doubt anyone has done that particular comparo.
