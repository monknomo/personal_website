I knocked together a \ `quick app`_ to keep track of R and my's progress
on C25K.  When I started out, I was using \ `skeleton`_ for the layout,
but I got frustrated with its documentation and some behavior with
spacing between rows and columns that took (I felt) too much
micromanaging.

I switched over to just using the \ `Goldilocks approach`_ and a little
bit of custom css for keeping tracks of row vs column divs and was
pretty happy with how it worked out and with how easy Goldilocks turned
out to be.

lines, and put together a tutorial at the same time.  It might be easy
